Financial News Data:**\n","    - Load a preprocessed dataset of financial news headlines and summaries related to S&P 500 companies.\n","    - Inspect and structure relevant metadata including publication date, ticker, and provider.\n","\n"," 2. **Build a Custom Vector Store:**\n","    - Combine title and summary text for embedding.\n","    - Implement a vector store from scratch with support for semantic search and optional metadata-based filtering using cosine similarity.\n","\n"," 3. **Generate and Use Sentence Embeddings:**\n","    - Apply a pre-trained transformer model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) to encode text into embeddings for semantic analysis.\n","\n"," 4. **Perform Semantic Search with Filtering:**\n","    - Retrieve the most relevant news documents for a given query using both full-dataset and metadata-filtered searches.\n","\n"," 5. **Analyze Semantic Search Results:**\n","    - Interpret and visualize results of search queries (e.g., \"AI announcement\").\n","    - Identify temporal patterns and ticker frequency among top-ranked results.\n","\n"," 6. **Implement a FAISS-Based Vector Store:**\n","    - Normalize embeddings and use FAISS (IndexFlatIP) to enable efficient similarity search at scale.\n","    - Compare FAISS-based search results with custom vector store results.\n","\n"," 7. **Critically Compare Search Systems:**\n","    - Evaluate differences in similarity computation, speed, and scalability between custom and FAISS-based systems.\n","    - Reflect on design trade-offs for real-world vector search systems."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"c1034130","metadata":{"id":"c1034130"},"source":["## Install and Import important

Richard Anderson, Wedbush managing director of equity research for REITs, joins Catalysts to provide insights into this segment of the market. Anderson observes an \"instant gratification\" scenario unfolding in REITs, noting their quick recovery despite the weaker state of the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX). He explains that \"any kind of investment vehicle with an income component like the REITs\" tends to thrive in a declining rate environment. However, he raises questions about the longer-term outlook, wondering, \"What does a better rate environment, a normal sloping yield curve, do to people's attention of the fundamentals of commercial real estate?\" describing this as \"the next leg of opportunity\" for the sector. Anderson points out that uncertainty within the 10-year yield curve affects REITs' ability to deploy capital and grow earnings.

Interest rate-sensitive REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) are set to benefit from the Federal Reserve's anticipated easing of monetary policy. Richard Anderson, Wedbush managing director of equity research for REITs, joins Catalysts to provide insights into this segment of the market. Anderson observes an \"instant gratification\" scenario unfolding in REITs, noting their quick recovery despite the weaker state of the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX). He explains that \"any kind of investment vehicle with an income component like the REITs\" tends to thrive in a declining rate environment. However, he raises questions about the longer-term outlook, wondering, \"What does a better rate environment, a normal sloping yield curve, do to people's attention of the fundamentals of commercial real estate?\" describing this as \"the next leg of opportunity\" for the sector. Anderson points out that uncertainty within the 10-year yield curve affects REITs' ability to deploy capital and grow earnings. He emphasizes, \"The real thing that we're watching is the longer end of the curve. And if we get some certainty there, then it's perhaps off to the races, and perhaps we'll have an outperformance here in 2024 from the REITs.\" Watch the video above to hear what Anderson thinks are the most attractive investment opportunities in REITs.&nbsp; For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Catalysts.

When vectors are normalized to unit length, the inner product between them effectively becomes the cosine similarity, which measures the angle between the vectors rather than the magnitude. Without normalization, longer vectors could dominate the similarity score purely due to their length, regardless of their semantic content. Thus, normalization ensures that comparisons are based on meaning, not scale, leading to more reliable and interpretable results."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"c8d99e5d","metadata":{"id":"c8d99e5d"},"source":["\n","### **Q6.**  What would happen if vectors were not normalized before indexing?"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"f3555035","metadata":{"id":"f3555035"},"source":["\n"," YOUR WRITTEN RESPONSE HERE\n","\n","If vectors are not normalized before indexing, the similarity scores can become misleading. This is because the inner product will then depend on both the direction and the magnitude of the vectors. As a result, documents with larger norms might appear more similar than they actually are, even if their directions diverge significantly. This violates the assumption behind cosine similarity that only the direction of the vectors matters for measuring semantic similarity. Therefore, similarity scores no longer reflect true angular similarity and can be skewed by the length of the vectors, leading to inaccurate and biased retrieval results.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"219a98d4","metadata":{"id":"219a98d4"},"source":["\n","## 🧠 Critical Thinking / Design Choices"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"d1f51461","metadata":{"id":"d1f51461"},"source":["\n","### **Q7.** Which implementation would you choose for a production-scale search system?
